# Clubs Projection Piece

### Goal

Make an interactive art exhibit that club leaders can set up in their schools. Something akin to [Karl Sims' work](https://www.karlsims.com/).

### TODO

all of it (lol)

- get generative piece to interact with live-stream of person
	- one possible technique is subtracting background has reference and using remaining (new shapes) as interactive objects
- get particle system running
- make sound from "interaction" with particle system
- run on raspberry pie
- figure out how someone could add to this piece easily (with-in 1 hour of beginning to code)
